// Welcome to the Swift REPL, this is a local environment
// which gives you a chance to write, share and learn Swift.

// You could think of it in three ways:
//
//  - A tool for learning Swift on your local setup
//  - A sandbox for experimenting with Swift syntax and features
//  - A way to share your experiments and repositories with others

let anExampleVariable = "Hello World"
print(anExampleVariable)

// To get started, remove these comments and start exploring.
// The world of Swift is yours to discover!
